# Strategy Pattern

## When to Use the Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it. This pattern is useful when you need to select an algorithm at runtime based on some condition or user input.

### Examples of Use Cases:

- Implementing different sorting algorithms that can be selected at runtime.
- Configuring different payment methods in an e-commerce application.
- Switching between different compression algorithms based on user preferences.

## Patterns That Work Well Together

The Strategy Pattern often works well with the following design patterns:

- **Factory Pattern**: Factories can be used to create instances of strategies.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Strategies can be combined with Decorators to add additional behavior.
- **Composite Pattern**: Can be used to create a complex strategy from simpler ones.
