# Factory Pattern

## When to Use the Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. It provides a way to delegate the instantiation of objects to subclasses. This pattern is useful when the creation process is complex or involves multiple steps, or when you want to abstract away the creation logic from the client.

### Examples of Use Cases:

- Creating objects that require a lot of setup or configuration.
- Managing and encapsulating the instantiation logic for a family of related objects.
- Providing a layer of abstraction between the creation of objects and the client code.

## Patterns That Work Well Together

The Factory Pattern often works well with the following design patterns:

- **Singleton Pattern**: Factories can be used to manage the creation of Singleton instances.
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Prototype Pattern**: Factories can use prototypes to create objects by copying existing instances.
