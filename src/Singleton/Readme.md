# Singleton Pattern

## When to Use the Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as managing a connection to a database or logging mechanism.

### Examples of Use Cases:

- Managing a shared resource like a database connection or configuration settings.
- Implementing a logger that is used throughout the application.
- Ensuring that only one instance of a class is created and used globally.

## Patterns That Work Well Together

The Singleton Pattern often works well with the following design patterns:

- **Factory Pattern**: Factories can manage the creation of Singleton instances.
- **Facade Pattern**: Singletons can be used within a Facade to provide a single point of access to multiple subsystems.
- **State Pattern**: Singletons can manage states that are shared across the application.
