# Singleton Pattern

## Introduction

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.

## Key Features

1. **Single Instance**: Ensures that only one instance of the class exists.
2. **Global Access Point**: Provides a global point of access to the instance.

## Implementation

1. **Private Constructor**: Make the constructor private to prevent instantiation from outside the class.
2. **Static Method**: Provide a static method that returns the instance of the class.
