# Builder Pattern

## When to Use the Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step. It allows you to create different types and representations of an object using the same construction code. This pattern is particularly useful when the construction process of an object is complex, involves multiple steps, or requires several configurations.

### Examples of Use Cases:

- Constructing complex objects like cars, buildings, or documents with various configurations.
- Creating objects that require numerous parameters or complex initialization.
- Building objects with different representations, such as text and HTML representations of a document.

## Patterns That Work Well Together

The Builder Pattern often works well with the following design patterns:

- **Factory Method Pattern**: Factories can delegate the construction of complex objects to builders.
- **Prototype Pattern**: Builders can be used in conjunction with prototypes to copy existing objects and then modify them.
- **Composite Pattern**: Builders can construct complex composite objects.
